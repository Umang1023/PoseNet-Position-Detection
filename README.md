<h2># Pose Detection Using PoseNet | Real-Time Pose Estimation </h2>

<h3> Overview </h3>
This project leverages the PoseNet model to detect human poses in real time. The application identifies 17 key body points (such as eyes, nose, elbows, and knees) and draws a visual representation (skeleton) of the detected poses. It is designed for educational purposes and to showcase the integration of machine learning into interactive applications.

The project currently focuses on:

- Real-time video processing
- Pose estimation with the PoseNet deep learning model
- Visualizing detected key points and skeletons
This project lays the foundation for future work in gesture recognition and sign language interpretation.

<h3>Features </h3>
- **Real-Time Pose Detection**: Uses the camera feed to estimate and display body keypoints in real-time.
- **Skeleton Visualization**: Draws connections between detected keypoints to form a human skeleton.
- **Interactive Design**: Provides a flipped (mirror) video for a user-friendly interface.

<h2> Technologies Used </h2>
- ml5.js: A JavaScript library built on top of TensorFlow.js for easy-to-use machine learning models.
- p5.js: A JavaScript library for creative coding, enabling graphics and interaction.
- PoseNet: A deep learning model for pose estimation.

<h3>Setup Instructions</h3>
1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure you have the following files:
    - index.html
    - sketch.js (contains the code for pose detection)
3. Use a local development server to run the project (e.g., using VS Code with the Live Server extension or Python's SimpleHTTPServer).
Steps:
1. Install a local server if you donâ€™t have one:
2. Navigate to the project folder and open it in a browser using the local server.

<h3>Future Improvements </h3>
Gesture Recognition for Interaction:

Develop a gesture recognition system using detected poses.
Recognize specific gestures to trigger actions (e.g., control devices or applications).
Sign Language Interpretation:

Enhance the model to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) or similar sign languages.
Translate gestures into text or speech to aid communication for deaf and mute individuals.
Custom Pose Detection:

Expand the application to detect specific poses or movements in sports, fitness, or dance.
Integration with Other Models:

Use advanced pose estimation models for higher accuracy and additional features.
